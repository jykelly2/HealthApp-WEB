# Health App  
Health App is an all-in-one health platform where users can explore and discover health-related information such as healthy recipes and health-related news. This health-related information is extracted from using external APIs and is used to create associated objects from extracted JSON data. 

A user can also create an account with their general information and their physical information, and in return, Health App would calculate the user's BMI and email the result as well as a recommended health website depending on the user's input and their Health Focus and Interest Level. 

Health App is also a **responsive web app** that changes its layouts according to screen size and it works in all screen types.
